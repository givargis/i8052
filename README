The 8052 is an 8-bit microcontroller originally developed by Intel in 1980.
I've recently resurrected an old project that I started during my time as a
PhD student in 1999. Back then, I needed some synthesizable models, and the
8052 seemed like a suitable candidate.

I'm now creating a new repository for this project and plan to make minor
improvements to the original model, as time permits.
